/**
 * This is a special RunnableFuture implementation ONLY FOR the case that when
 * in a non-GL thread you want to push a asynchronous call with return value to
 * GL thread, ex. trying to update bitmap of a texture in input event thread.
 * 
 * Please be aware that this is not a common Future implementation. It is not
 * recommended to use this class for common Future use like
 * Thread.start(GVRFutureOnGlThread).
 * 
 * The most common use cases should be with GVRContext.runOnGlThread. You can
 * submit the call request through GVRContext.runOnGlThread(GVRFutureOnGlThread)
 * and get the result with get() method. Just be careful that it's best to call
 * GVRContext.runOnGlThread(GVRFutureOnGlThread) when
 * GVRContext.isCurrentThreadGLThread() returns false since you can directly
 * call GVRFutureOnGlThread.run() while in GL thread.
