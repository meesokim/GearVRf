/**
 * An event receiver can contain a list of listeners, and deliver events to
 * them upon request. It can be added as a field of any event receiving
 * object, and handle events for them.
 *
 * To ensure all events can be received by scripts as well as listeners, this
 * class doesn't provide an API to directly deliver events to the listeners.
 * Instead, events should be delivered via the {@link GVREventManager}. Usage
 * of this {@code GVREventReceiver} is the following:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Add interface {@link IEventReceiver} to a class which need use listeners to
 * handle events. Without listeners, it can only receive events from {@link GVREventManager}
 * by directly implementing a subclass of interface {@link IEvents}.</li>
 * <li>Add a field containing a {@link GVREventReceiver} object.</li>
 * <li>Implement the method {@link IEventReceiver#getEventReceiver()} to return
 * this {@link GVREventReceiver} object.</li>
 * </ol>
 * After implementing the above pattern, {@link GVREventManager#sendEvent(Object, Class, String, Object...)}
 * can be used to deliver events to the class. Note that a target object can only have
 * one listener for each event class. Subsequent listeners for the same target and class
 * are ignored.
